# Ruby Code Katas Trail - Exercise #1

## Getting started

Firstly, make sure that you've created an account on Codelix (using github Oauth) by going to https://www.codelix.co.uk/users/auth/github

You'll also need to be added to [this github team](https://github.com/orgs/codelix-org/teams/access-to-codelix) 
(if you can't access this page then you won't be able to push to the repos). 
You only need to be added once, please 
message @Robfaldo (or slack or robertfaldo@gmail.com) to request this. 

```
# Create a folder for the trail 
mkdir ruby-katas-trail
cd ruby-katas-trail

# Clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:codelix-org/ruby-kata-exercise-1.git
cd ruby-kata-exercise-1

# Install dependencies
bundle

# create branch for your name
git checkout -b CHANGETOYOURNAME

# See the failing specs
bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```

## Exercise instructions

Update the `call` method on the `MoveZeros` class to moves all of the zeros of an array to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

There is already code that will validate the input for you. 

Feel free to look at `spec/reorder_nummbers/move_zeroes_spec.rb` to see the specs that will mark this test, but please do not edit this file.

Example: 

```ruby
array = [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0]
result = ReorderNumbers::MoveZeros.call(array)

result == [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
# true
```

When you've completed the task, push your branch to github and create a PR for the branch. 

## Marking this exercise

This exercise is marked automatically by a github action. When you create a PR (or push commits to an opened PR) 
it will run the specs, and if they pass it will send a notification to Codelix to notify you have passed the exercise. 

You should see this updated fairly quickly in https://www.codelix.co.uk/ but if you don't you can check the `Actions` tab in this repo 
to see if the action failed and reach out to @Robfaldo for help.
